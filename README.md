# QR Code Generator Python Project

## Project Overview

The QR Code Generator Python Project is a simple yet powerful tool designed to create QR codes for various types of data, such as URLs, text, or contact information. Built using Python, this project leverages libraries like qrcode and Pillow to generate customizable QR codes that can be saved as image files.

This project serves as a practical example for beginners to learn about Python programming and the creation of QR codes while being useful for real-world applications such as marketing, contactless payments, and information sharing.
